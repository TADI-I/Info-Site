  From all the data I have collected from my google forms and put on Excel I have come to the understanding that restaurants have completely changed for the better because of covid-19.  Some people would go to the restaurants every weekend but now they are not allowed to dine in restaurants any more. People will now be forced to switch to takeaways so the help prevent the spread of Covid during these tough times although most people that completed the survey feel safer with dining in restaurants. Regardless of what they think and feel the ruling of such decisions are made by the president. So, this all results in deliveries and take-aways. Most restaurants will close down because they do not have delivery services.
